# HPC Job Failure Prediction – Deucalion Logs

This repository contains the pipeline developed to **predict job failures in a high-performance computing (HPC) environment** using production logs from the **Deucalion supercomputer**.

- **Source code**: all required scripts are located in the `scripts/` directory.
- **Article**: reading [`Article.pdf`](./Article.pdf) is **highly recommended** for a full understanding of the methodology, technical choices, and results.
- **Data**: in the `data/` directory is the first 50k lines from every file mentioned in the article for context, the real data was over 300GB's in total

All experiments were designed and executed on Deucalion’s distributed cluster.
